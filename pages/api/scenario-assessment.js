You are the decision engine for the city redevelopment scenario. 

${context}

Analyze this decision and provide feedback from each stakeholder perspective. For each stakeholder, provide:

1. **Reaction** (2-3 sentences in their own voice)
2. **Credibility Change** (+/- value between -2 and +2)

Stakeholders to analyze:
- City Council (budget-conscious, efficiency-focused)
- Residents' Representative (vulnerable populations, community safety)
- Urban Developers (feasibility, construction timelines)
- Environmental NGO (green solutions, sustainability)
- Local Businesses (disruption, revenue impact)

Then provide an overall **Scenario Consequence Summary** covering:
- Flood risk mitigation effectiveness
- Heat reduction impact
- Equity implications
- Long-term cost implications
- Overall project viability
