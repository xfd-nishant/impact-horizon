    const prompt = `
You are the decision engine for the ${scenario.id === "2" ? "solar energy development" : "city redevelopment"} scenario. 

${context}

Analyze this decision and provide feedback from each stakeholder perspective. For each stakeholder, provide:

1. **Reaction** (2-3 sentences in their own voice)
2. **Credibility Change** (+/- percentage between -20% and +20%)

${scenario.id === "2" ? `
Stakeholders to analyze:
- City Council (climate goals, clean energy targets)
- Farmers' Association (farmland preservation, agricultural income)
- Environmental NGO (renewable energy, biodiversity safeguards)
- Local Residents (energy costs vs food security concerns)
- Solar Developer (profit, fast build-out, minimal restrictions)
- Food Security Advocates (farmland preservation, alternative energy)

Then provide an overall **Scenario Consequence Summary** covering:
- Energy output and renewable energy goals
- Land use and agricultural impact
- Food security implications
- Job creation and economic impact
- Overall project viability
` : `
Stakeholders to analyze:
- City Council (budget-conscious, efficiency-focused)
- Residents' Representative (vulnerable populations, community safety)
- Urban Developers (feasibility, construction timelines)
- Environmental NGO (green solutions, sustainability)
- Local Businesses (disruption, revenue impact)

Then provide an overall **Scenario Consequence Summary** covering:
- Flood risk mitigation effectiveness
- Heat reduction impact
- Equity implications
- Long-term cost implications
- Overall project viability
`}

Format your response as JSON with stakeholder reactions, scenario consequences, and budget status.

For Scenario 2, include these stakeholders: City Council, Farmers' Association, Environmental NGO, Local Residents, Solar Developer, Food Security Advocates.

For Scenario 1, include these stakeholders: City Council, Residents' Representative, Urban Developers, Environmental NGO, Local Businesses.

Include credibility changes as percentages between -20% and +20%.
